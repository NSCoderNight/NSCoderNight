Sad news: I'm going to be closing this site down shortly.

Since the almost four years that it was created, this site's technical underpinnings have become obsolete. It looks like it would require a full rewrite to replace them, and I can't currently justify that effort.

I created this site to replace an earlier out-of-date NSCoderNight website. I hoped that I could help both rejuvenate my local chapter, in San Francisco, and provide a resource for the NSCoderNight chapters around the world.

Unfortunately, the San Francisco chapter continued its decline in attendance, and is not currently meeting.

And to my surprise, I found that most of the other NSCoderNight chapters, the vast majority, already self-organize just fine through <a href="https://www.meetup.com">Meeting.com</a>, and don't really need this site.

I'll be keeping the <a href="https://twitter.com/nscodernight">Twitter account</a> open, in case that's helpful to anyone.

It's too bad this site didn't work out, but I wish everyone the best with their local chapters!
