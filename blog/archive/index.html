				<li>March 29, 2020, by Andrew Pontious<h2><a href="/blog/2020/03/29/closing-down/index.html" title="Closing Down">Closing Down</a></h2><p>Sad news: I'm going to be closing this site down shortly.</p>

<p>Since the almost four years that it was created, this site's technical underpinnings have become obsolete. It looks like it would require a full rewrite to replace them, and I can't currently justify that effort.</p>

<p>I created this site to replace an earlier out-of-date NSCoderNight website. I hoped that I could help both rejuvenate my local chapter, in San Francisco, and provide a resource for the NSCoderNight chapters around the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the San Francisco chapter continued its decline in attendance, and is not currently meeting.</p>

<p>And to my surprise, I found that most of the other NSCoderNight chapters, the vast majority, already self-organize just fine through <a href="https://www.meetup.com">Meeting.com</a>, and don't really need this site.</p>

<p>I'll be keeping the <a href="https://twitter.com/nscodernight">Twitter account</a> open, in case that's helpful to anyone.</p>

<p>It's too bad this site didn't work out, but I wish everyone the best with their local chapters!</p>

Thanks to the organizers of these chapters for letting us know their information.</p>

<p>Those chapters already existed, but <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliaCodes">Amelia Boli</a> is looking to <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliaCodes/status/612037483174309888">start up a new Phoenix, AZ chapter</a>. If you have suggestions for meeting locations or are interesting in attending, please let her know!</p>

						<li>June 6, 2015, by Andrew Pontious<h2><a href="/blog/2015/06/06/new-website/index.html" title="New Website">New Website</a></h2><p>I'm very excited to introduce the new NSCoderNight website.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrh_is">Michael Helmbrecht</a> for the website design, <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_critz">Mike Critz</a> for his help with CSS and design issues, and <a href="https://twitter.com/segiddins">Samuel Giddins</a> for his invaluable efforts in setting up the Middleman templates for the site and the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/NSCoderNight/NSCoderNight">Travis CI continuous build system</a> that it relies on. And a special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/eschaton">Chris Hanson</a> for founding and fostering NSCoderNight all these years. This wouldn't exist without all your efforts.</p>

<p>The Mac/iPhone/etc. developer community has grown substantially since NSCoderNight started in late 2007. But I think NSCoderNight still stands out as a place where developers can just relax, hang out, and share tips.</p>

<p>So go find your <a href="/chapters">local chapter</a> and attend, or <a href="/starting">start up a new chapter</a> chapter where you are. We're happy to help, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do.</p>
